lmt_agg.cron \- aggregate LMT data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "lmt_agg.cron [OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lmt_agg.cron
populates the LMT low-resolution (hour, day, week, month, year) data tables
using data from the high-resolution data tables.
The low-resolution data is used by the LMT java clients to speed up 
real-time generation of historical graphs.
If this capability is not desired, you may choose not to run \fBlmt_agg.cron\fR.
.LP
.B lmt_agg.cron
is normally run hourly by cron on the LMT server host:

.fi
.LP
\fBlmt_agg.cron\fR processes all the high-resolution data that has
