.SH NAME
lmt_agg.cron \- aggregate LMT data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "lmt_agg.cron [OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lmt_agg.cron
populates the LMT low-resolution (hour, day, week, month, year) data tables
using data from the high-resolution data tables.
The low-resolution data is used by the LMT java clients to speed up 
real-time generation of historical graphs.
If this capability is not desired, you may choose not to run \fBlmt_agg.cron\fR.
.LP
.B lmt_agg.cron
is normally run hourly by cron on the LMT server host:

.fi
.LP
\fBlmt_agg.cron\fR processes all the high-resolution data that has
accumulated since its last run, based on comparing the most recent rows
inserted into the high and low resolution tables. Its runtime and temporary
storage requirements depened on how much data is processed.
