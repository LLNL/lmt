.SH NAME
lmtinit \- initialize LMT database 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "lmtinit [OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lmtinit
sets up MySQL for LMT use.
Each file system that will be monitored must have a database
populated with the lmt schema.  This can be set up with the
\fI--add FSNAME\fR option.
.LP
\fBlmtinit\fR requires that the LMT MySQL accounts
(see \fBMYSQL SETUP\fR below) be set up,
and that \fIlmt.conf\fR contains the database host, port, and users with 
appropriate access.
.SH OPTIONS
.B lmtinit 
accepts the following command line options:
.TP
.I "-a,--add FSNAME"
Create a database named \fIfilesystem\_FSNAME\fR and populate it with
tables per the LMT schema.
If database and table creation capabilities are not extended
to the \fIlmt\_db\_rwuser\fR, then a user and password having this
capability must be provided on the command line with
the \fI--user\fR and \fI--password\fR options.
.TP
.I "-d,--delete FSNAME"
Drop a database named \fIfilesystem\_FSNAME\fR.
If database drop capability is not extended
to the \fIlmt\_db\_rwuser\fR, then a user and password having this
capability must be provided on the command line with
the \fI--user\fR and \fI--password\fR options.
.TP
.I "-l,--list"
List the currently configured file systems.
If database list capability is not extended
to the \fIlmt\_db\_rouser\fR, then a user and password having this
capability must be provided on the command line with
the \fI--user\fR and \fI--password\fR options.
.TP
.I "-c,--config-file FILE"
Use an alternate \fIlmt.conf\fR.
.TP
.I "-s,--schema-file FILE"
Use an alternate schema file.
.TP
.I "-u,--user=USER"
Connect to the database as USER.
The default is to use the users configured in \fIlmt.conf\fR.
.TP
.I "-p,--password=PASS"
Connect to the database with password PASS.
The default is to use the passwords configured in \fIlmt.conf\fR.
.TP
.I "-P,--prompt-password"
Same as above but prompt for the password interactively.
.TP
.I "-x,--dump-config"
Print configuration information for read-write database connect.
(Helper function for \flLMT.pm\fR).
.SH MYSQL SETUP
Refer to MySQL documentation to determine how to set up and secure your
MySQL database, and create the LMT users.
.LP
The \fBmysql_secure_installation\fR program can be used to secure your
database, including changing the database root password.
.LP
LMT needs a read-only and a read/write user for accessing the database.
These users and their passwords are stored in \fIlmt.conf\fR, using
a strategy such as the one shown in \fIlmt.conf(5)\fR for protecting
the read/write password.  Users can be created using a variant of the
\fImkusers.sql\fR example script (see below).
.SH CRON SETUP
The \fBlmt_agg.cron\fR script may optionally be run to create low-resolution
data used to speed up real-time historical graphing in the java client.
See \fIlmt_agg.cron(8)\fR for more information.
