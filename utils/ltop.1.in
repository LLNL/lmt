.SH NAME
ltop \- display live information about a Lustre file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ltop [OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ltop
displays information about a live Lustre file system monitored by LMT.
.SH OPTIONS
.B ltop
accepts the following command line options:
.TP
.I "-f,--filesystem FSNAME"
Monitor the file system named FSNAME.
You may monitor only one file system per \fBltop\fR session.
The default is to monitor the first file system found.
.TP
.I "-t,--sample-period SECS"
Change the display refresh period from the default of two seconds.
.TP
.I "-r,--record FILE"
Log raw data from the session to FILE, so it can be played back with \fI\-p\fR.
.TP
.I "-p,--play FILE"
Play back raw data from FILE recorded with \fI\-r\fR or with the
interactive \fIR\fR command.
.SH "MDT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fIMDT\fR
The mdt index, in hex.  In the compressed view (c below), the number of MDT's
on the MDS is displayed in parenthesis.
.TP
\fIMDS\fR
The MDS hostname.
.TP
\fIOpen\fR
The number of file opens per second.
.TP
\fIClose\fR
The number of file closes per second.
.TP
\fIGetattr\fR
The number of file or directory getattrs per second.
.TP
\fISetattr\fR
The number of file or directory setattrs per second.
.TP
\fIUnlink\fR
The number of file unlinks per second.
.TP
\fIMkdir\fR
The number of mkdirs per second.
.TP
\fIRmdir\fR
The number of rmdirs per second.
.TP
\fIRename\fR
The number of files or directories renamed per second.
.SH "OST FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fIOST\fR
The ost index, in hex.  In the compressed view (c below), the number of OST's
on the OSS is displayed in parenthesis.
.TP
\fIS\fR
OSC status.  The MDS's view of the OST is shown here.  The OSC state is
abbreviated as follows:  \fIC\fR closed, \fIN\fR new, \fID\fR disconn,
\fIc\fR connecting, \fIr\fR replay, \fIl\fR replay_locks, \fIw\fR replay_wait,
\fIR\fR recover, \fIF\fR full, \fIE\fR evicted.  The normal state is \fIF\fR.
.TP
\fIOSS\fR
The OSS hostname.
.TP
\fIExp\fR
Export count.  There will be one export for each client mounting the
file system plus one for the MDS and one for the OST itself.
.TP
\fICR\fR
The number of (re-)connects per second.
.TP
\fIrMB/s\fR
Read megabytes per second.
.TP
\fIwMB/s\fR
Write megabytes per second.
.TP
\fIIOPS\fR
Bulk RPC's per second (read and write combined).
In an ideal world, all bulk I/O would be 1MB, i.e. equal to the sum of
\fIrMB/s\fR and \fIwMB/s\fR.
.TP
\fILOCKS\fR
The number of locks on OST resources currently granted.
.TP
\fILGR\fR
The lock grant rate.
.TP
\fILCR\fR
The lock cancellation rate.
.TP
\fI%spc
The percentage of OST storage space in use.
.SH "COMMON FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fI%cpu
The percentage of cpu in use on the server.
.TP
\fI%mem
The percentage of memory in use on the server.
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.B ltop
responds to the following single character commands interactively:
.TP
\fIq\fR
Terminate the
.B ltop
program.
.TP
\fIz\fR
Switch the cursor between the OST and MDT windows.
.TP
\fIPageDown\fR
Page down through target information if it won't fit on screen.
.TP
\fIPageUp\fR
Page up through target information if it won't fit on screen.
.TP
\fIP\fR
Toggle proportional and priority view. These view modes determine how many lines
are given to MDTs vs OSTs. Proportional view sets the number of lines based on
the relative numbers of MDTs and OSTs. Priority view displays as many lines as
can fit of whichever category of servers is selected by the cursor and uses any
remaining lines for the other server category. The cursor is toggled with
.B z.
The default is priority view of the OSTs.
.TP
\fIc\fR
Toggle compressed target view.  The default mode is to display one line per
target.  In compressed mode, one line per server is displayed.  Numerical data
is summed in the server view except for the export count where the minimum
export count of any target is displayed.  Also if any of the target's is in
recovery, recovery information for that target will be shown in the server
view.

Initially, entries are sorted by the leftmost field, OST/MDT index.

Sort MDT/OST window by the next field to the left, wrapping around at the end.
Initially, entries are sorted by the leftmost field, OST/MDT index.
