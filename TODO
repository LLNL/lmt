TODO list (remove items when complete)

Feedback from demo of 3.0-pre7 to LLNL lustre admin team 2010-10-13:

- ltop
  . when aggregating ost's in oss view, and mult ost's are in recovery,
    select ost with longest recovery time [Marc Stearman]
  . like TIVO: pause, rewind, play live tv in ltop [Ned Bass]

- consider replacing java clients with PHP for web view [Jim Silva]
  . possibly aggregation tables are not necessary

- LMT could subsume "lustre metrics" project [Jim Silva]
  . monitor a sampling of clients
  . maybe n of m osc's in full state?
  . mdc also?

- GUI client should display new info added to ltop [Jim Harm]
  . requires db schema change

- When ltop can read /proc directly, consider adding client stats
  . sometimes users want to know what's going on on particular client
    and this is difficult to determine [Marc Stearman]

Feedback from demo of 3.0-pre8 to CUG at NERSC 2010-10-28:

- ltop should highlight column that is used for sorting [Andrew Uselton]
